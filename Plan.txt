Plan your project

Visualize your end result.
What is it built with?  -> returning strings that have been interpolated.
What can it do? -> log sentences that make sense
Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that arenâ€™t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

Do two blocks a day:
Thursday:
    Create a script and run it locally
    Set up version control
Friday:
    Store message components
    Create the message
Saturday:
    Put the program together
    Next Steps

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

Come Up with a Topic
Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output. -> Output positive messages.
-> Hey (positive noun)! (positive message). Didn't anyone tell you, (nice adage);
